# 🍔 Krusty Krab Digital Twin

A comprehensive digital transformation project that creates a complete digital twin of the Krusty Krab restaurant, simulating all operational, financial, and physical aspects in a virtual environment.

## 📋 Project Overview

This project aims to develop a complete digital replica of the Krusty Krab, including all business processes, physical systems, and operational flows. The digital twin will enable data-driven decision making, process optimization, and scenario planning in a simulated environment.

### Goals

- Create a virtual replica of the Krusty Krab that accurately simulates real-world operations
- Enable data-driven decision making for operational efficiency
- Provide a platform for testing process improvements without disrupting actual business
- Develop a training environment for new employees
- Modernize legacy systems with digital transformation

## 🏗️ Architecture

This project implements a multi-tier architecture that includes:

- Network infrastructure with segmented VLANs for management, operations, and customers
- Multi-database approach using PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and InfluxDB for different data needs
- Microservices for core business functions (ordering, kitchen, inventory, etc.)
- IoT sensor network for real-time operational monitoring
- Advanced analytics with predictive capabilities
- 3D visualization of restaurant operations and processes

Detailed architecture documentation can be found in the [docs/architecture](docs/architecture) folder.
